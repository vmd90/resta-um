<h1>Triangular Peg Solitaire</h1>
Simple implementation of game Triangular Peg Solitaire using IA concepts, such as: game tree, depth-first search and A* search.
<br><br>
I used Netbeans IDE 8.0 to run it, but it's simple to compile the source files using javac and run:<br>
<code>java PegSolitaire 0 board.txt</code>
<br>
where argument 0 means depth-first search and 1 means A* search, and <code>board.txt</code> means the text file with the initial state.
